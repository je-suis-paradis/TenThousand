*Cross your fingers and throw your bones. But to win, you need to push your luck. Again and again, and again.*

## üé¨
It's Thursday evening, family game night. Dad is shining his "special" dice. You let out a silent sigh, knowing that within a few seconds, he'll shout from the top of his lungs, "Guys!? Hey, guys, are you ready to get your behinds handed to you once again in a game of Farkle!?" Those dice are special, but only because they keep things peaceful and calm. So you let him win. But what if you were to change the rules. Only once. But change them completely.

## üé≤ About Ten Thousand
Elements of chance, surprise, luck, and randomness are present in a lot of games. In Yahtzee, poker, and all the great rougelites, no two runs play the same. Throw yourself head first into the unknown, where you don't know what awaits, only that you'll use the six die in your hand. 

Ten Thousand is a straight-forward, no BS, rougelite dice game, in some aspects, loosely based on the classic, Farkle. Throw those bones, push your luck, and you might be the one to collect ten thousand points. It's really that simple.

‚Ä¢ Randomly generated encounters
‚Ä¢ Unique scoring system and multiplying buffers
‚Ä¢ Short, but not always sweet, fast runs of risk and reward
‚Ä¢ High replayability
‚Ä¢ To truly master the game, complete the tutorial
‚Ä¢ Neat and unclutterd UI, for a game that runs in your console
‚Ä¢ Great possibilities to expand the game and develop a pretty GUI, later on fram

## Background
It's a clich√©, but only because everyone knows it to be true. Learning to code is not something you do in a heart beat, 
and we've all heard the advice more times than we care to remember: "Get ready, let's create your very own working calculator, 
and heaps of other fun projects like weather apps, and to-do apps." 

This app is an iteration of the first app idea I ever had. After making a decision to learn programming, I stumbled out on the command line,
it disappeared out the window. And it was only after months of dedicated keyboard wrangling, juggling code, 
writing bash scripts, and building quiz apps I realized: *this IS the game I need to make first.*

This app also serves as a laboratory for me as a developer. 
Building to understand structures, modular design, throughput, 
and how to write code for addictive game loops.

## üîß Tech & Dev
- Language: C#
- Environment: .NET / Console app
- Focus: Simple, structured code base, crystal clear methods, and JSON storing runs and scores
- Structure: Functionality first, scalability next

I run this project parallell to the quiz app mentioned earlier, with the ambition to learn more and take the next giant leap on my journey, to become a skilled, versatile developer, and game designer

## üèÅ Concluding Thoughts
Maybe this isn't the game to win me any prizes. But it is what makes me set my alarm to 5:45 am, to write a new method. It's the beginning of a loop that gets better every time you run it.
